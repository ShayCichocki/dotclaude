# Getting Startup Ideas

How to find ideas worth pursuing.

## The Problem-Centric Approach

"The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself."

### Why This Works

- You know the problem is real (you have it)
- You understand the pain intimately
- You're your own first user
- Passion comes naturally when solving your own problems

### The Mistake

Most people try to think of startup ideas directly. This produces ideas that sound plausible but aren't grounded in real need.

## The "Well" Model

### Depth Over Breadth

"You can either dig a hole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow and deep, like a well."

- Build something a small number of people desperately need
- NOT something many people mildly want
- Desperate need creates word-of-mouth
- Mild interest creates nothing

### How to Tell the Difference

- Would users be genuinely upset if your product disappeared?
- Are they recommending it unprompted?
- Do they describe it as something they "can't live without"?

## Live in the Future

"Live in the future and build what's missing."

### The Formula

1. Develop expertise at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field
2. Notice things that seem missing or broken
3. Build them

### What This Requires

- Genuine knowledge and experience
- Not abstract theorizing
- Being a practitioner, not just an observer
- Years of immersion, not weekend research

## The Organic Method

### Background Awareness

Rather than forcing ideas through brainstorming:
- Maintain a background awareness of gaps and anomalies
- Develop "a second self watching over your shoulder"
- Note when you think "why doesn't X exist?" or "why is Y so hard?"
- Ideas accumulate naturally over time

### The Prepared Mind

Great startup ideas come to prepared minds. Preparation means:
- Domain expertise
- Technical capability to build
- Awareness of what's newly possible
- Pattern recognition from past experience

## Schlep Blindness

### The Hidden Opportunity

Most people unconsciously filter out ideas that seem like hard work. This "schlep blindness" hides the best opportunities.

Examples:
- Stripe: "Payments? That sounds like a nightmare of regulations."
- Airbnb: "Renting your home to strangers? Too weird."

### How to Overcome It

- Notice ideas you dismiss as "too much work"
- Ask: is this actually impossible, or just unpleasant?
- Unsexy, tedious problems often have the best risk/reward

## Unsexy Ideas

The best startup ideas are often:
- **Unglamorous**: Boring to most people
- **Schlep-heavy**: Require tedious work
- **Niche**: Sound too narrow
- **Embarrassing**: Seem silly to sophisticated people

## Testing Ideas

When you identify a potential problem:
1. Talk to actual users about their pain points
2. Don't rely on assumptions about behavior
3. Watch people struggle, don't just ask
4. Prototype quickly to learn what's actually needed

## What to Avoid

- Ideas that sound good in a pitch but lack real need
- Problems you've never personally experienced
- "Made-up" startup ideas from brainstorming sessions
- Copying what's trendy without understanding why
