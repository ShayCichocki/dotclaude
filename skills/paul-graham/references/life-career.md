# Life and Career Wisdom

Paul Graham's advice beyond startups.

## How to Do Great Work

### The Core Principle

Work on something you're genuinely interested in. Don't compromise early.

"You have to work on something you're interested in. If you're not interested, you won't work hard enough, and you won't come up with good ideas."

### The Four Components

1. **Ability** - Natural aptitude for the domain
2. **Interest** - Genuine fascination with the subject
3. **Opportunity** - Access to problems worth solving
4. **Effort** - Willingness to work hard over time

### Following Curiosity

- Don't plan too rigidly
- Follow what genuinely interests you
- Let your interests evolve naturally
- The best work comes from genuine engagement

### The Importance of Projects

- Great work emerges from projects, not job descriptions
- Working on something you own creates different motivation
- Side projects often become main projects

### Morale as Fuel

"Morale is an essential component of doing great work. If you're not excited about what you're doing, you won't sustain the effort."

## Life is Short

### The Core Insight

Life is genuinely short. Act like it.

### Avoid Bullshit

"Bullshit" = tasks that don't matter but consume time:
- Status games
- Meaningless obligations
- Things done only because others expect them
- Work that doesn't engage you

### Prioritize Time with People

- Time with people you love is limited
- Don't defer important relationships
- The people won't always be there

### Don't Wait

- "Life is short" isn't just a phrase
- Don't postpone things that matter
- The future isn't guaranteed
- Time pressure clarifies priorities

### Pruning vs. Adding

Sometimes doing great work means:
- Saying no to opportunities
- Cutting commitments
- Protecting time ruthlessly
- Subtracting, not just adding

## How to Work Hard

### The Discovery

"Many people don't know what hard work feels like."

Hard work isn't:
- Being busy
- Feeling stressed
- Working long hours on the wrong things

Hard work is:
- Sustained focus on meaningful work
- Pushing past comfort zones
- Producing output, not just effort

### The Three Components

1. **Natural ability** - Some tasks are easier for you
2. **Practice** - Skill develops with repetition
3. **Effort** - Choosing to engage fully

### Finding Work That Feels Like Play

- The best workers don't feel like they're working
- Genuine interest transforms effort
- When work feels like play, you can sustain it indefinitely

### Beware of Faking

It's possible to:
- Feel busy without being productive
- Work long hours on the wrong things
- Mistake motion for progress

Check: are you producing results, or just working?

## On Writing

### Write to Think

"Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly."

### Simplicity

- Write simply
- Cut unnecessary words
- If a sentence can be shorter, make it shorter
- Complexity often hides unclear thinking

### Write Like You Talk

- Avoid formal language that you'd never speak
- Conversational writing is clearer
- If you can't say it naturally, you don't understand it well enough

## On Wealth and Success

### Wealth vs. Status

- Wealth creation isn't zero-sum
- Status competition is zero-sum
- Build things that make the pie bigger

### What Success Feels Like

- The best success comes from work you'd do anyway
- External validation fades; internal satisfaction lasts
- Build things you're proud of
