# Common Startup Mistakes

The errors that kill startups—and how to avoid them.

## The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups

### 1. Single Founder

- Startups are too hard for one person
- Cofounders provide support, complementary skills, accountability
- Going solo is a bad sign to investors
- The emotional burden alone can be crushing

### 2. Bad Location

- Startup hubs exist for a reason
- Access to investors, talent, other founders
- Culture of ambition and risk-taking
- Remote work has changed this, but location still matters

### 3. Marginal Niche

- Picking a niche to avoid competition often means no market
- If big companies haven't entered, ask why
- Often the answer is: not enough opportunity

### 4. Derivative Idea

- "Like X, but for Y" rarely works
- Copying without deep understanding of why X works
- Surface-level imitation misses the real insight

### 5. Obstinacy

- Refusing to change direction despite evidence
- "We just need more time" when the problem is the idea
- Flexibility is essential; stubbornness kills

### 6. Hiring Bad Programmers

- Early technical quality determines everything
- Bad code becomes technical debt that compounds
- You can't hire your way out of bad foundations

### 7. Choosing the Wrong Platform

- Technical decisions have long-term consequences
- Picking something trendy over something solid
- Not understanding the tradeoffs

### 8. Slowness in Launching

- Endless polishing before launch
- Fear of criticism prevents learning
- "If you're not embarrassed by v1, you launched too late"

### 9. Launching Too Early

- Launching before having something useful
- Burning your first impression
- Balance: launch fast, but launch something real

- Not leveraging their networks and expertise

### 15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) Profit

- Prioritizing short-term revenue over user value
- Dark patterns that degrade trust
- Forgetting that users are the real asset

### 16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty

- Avoiding the unsexy work
- Schlep blindness in execution, not just ideas
- Too proud for customer service, manual processes

### 17. Fights Between Founders

- Unresolved cofounder conflicts poison everything
- Equity disputes, role conflicts, vision disagreements

## The Hardest Lessons

From "The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn":

### Release Early

"Get a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users' reactions."

- Ship minimal but functional
- Real feedback > imagined feedback
- Speed creates urgency and reveals problems

### Keep Pumping Out Features

"The more ideas you implement, the more ideas you'll have."

- Continuous improvement demonstrates vitality
- Builds user loyalty through responsiveness
- Momentum matters

### Fear the Right Things

**Don't fear:**
- Established competitors (they're slow)
- Visible disasters (you can react)

**Do fear:**
- Unknown competing startups
- Ignoring users
- Internal dysfunction
- Problems you're avoiding

### Commitment is Self-Fulfilling

"Showing genuine commitment attracts investors and acquirers more effectively than any pitch."

Determination is visible. It attracts:

### There Is Always Room

Markets aren't "tapped out." Innovation persists across all domains and time periods.

Don't talk yourself out of ideas because "someone's already doing that."

### Don't Get Your Hopes Up

Assume deals won't materialize.

- Continues to pursue alternatives
- Maintains negotiating leverage
- Protects from emotional crash
- Keeps focus on what you control
