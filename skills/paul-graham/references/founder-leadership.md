# Founder Leadership

How founders should lead—and why conventional wisdom is wrong.

## Founder Mode vs Manager Mode

The most important leadership insight from 2024.

### Manager Mode

The conventional wisdom taught in business schools:
- Hire good people
- Delegate to your direct reports
- Treat organizational subtrees as "black boxes"
- Give people autonomy and stay out of their way
- Trust the process

### Founder Mode

What actually works for founder-led companies:
- Stay deeply involved across the organization
- Skip-level relationships are normal, not unusual
- Engage with people at all levels, not just directs
- Shape culture directly, not through layers
- Trust but verify

### The Key Insight

"The conventional wisdom about how to run larger companies is mistaken."

Brian Chesky followed the "hire good people and give them room" advice at Airbnb. The results were disastrous. When he switched to founder mode, the company thrived.

### The Gaslighting Problem

Founders face pressure from:
- VCs who think they know how to run companies
- Professional executives who want autonomy
- Business school graduates with theories
- The entire establishment saying "step back"

But: "C-level execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the world."

### Steve Jobs' Method

- Annual retreats with the 100 most important people at Apple
- Selection based on impact, not hierarchy
- Direct engagement with key contributors regardless of level
- Culture-shaping through personal involvement

### When to Use Founder Mode

- When you're the founder and know the business deeply
- When professional managers are creating bureaucracy
- When you sense the company is losing its soul
- When "best practices" are making things worse

### When to Be Careful

- Don't micromanage for its own sake
- Founder mode requires energy and attention
- Some delegation is necessary at scale
- The goal is impact, not control

## What YC Looks for in Founders

The qualities that predict success.

### 1. Determination

"The most important quality: determination. As long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what matters most is determination."

Not raw intelligence, but:
- Willingness to push through obstacles
- Refusal to accept "impossible"
- Persistence despite setbacks

### 2. Relentlessly Resourceful

"The best one-word description of what makes a good founder: relentlessly resourceful."

This means:
- Finding ways when there seems to be no way
- Creative problem-solving under constraints
- Never saying "we can't because..."

### 3. Flexibility

Successful founders:
- Adapt quickly to new information
- Pivot when necessary (not prematurely)
- Hold opinions loosely
- Listen to users over their own assumptions

### 4. Naughtiness

"The best founders have a piratical gleam in their eye."

They're:
- Willing to break rules that shouldn't exist
- Not too respectful of authority
- Comfortable with unconventional approaches
- Slightly dangerous in their ambition

### 5. Friendship with Cofounders

- Real relationship, not just business partnership
- Ability to disagree and resolve conflict
- Trust through shared history
- Complementary skills but shared values

## Leading Through Hard Times

### Keep Perspective

- Most successful companies nearly died at some point
- Hard times are normal, not a sign of failure
- The founders who succeed are those who don't quit

### Manage Your Psychology

- The startup will take as much as you give it
- You can't help the company if you're broken
- Sustainable intensity beats burnout

### Communicate with Clarity

- Don't hide problems from your team
- Be honest about challenges while maintaining confidence
- Share the burden; don't carry it alone
