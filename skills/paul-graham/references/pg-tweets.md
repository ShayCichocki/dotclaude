# Paul Graham's Twitter Wisdom

Memorable quotes and insights from @paulg.

## On Startups

> "Make something people want."

The YC motto and PG's core philosophy.

> "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late."

Ship fast. Learn fast.

> "The way to build a billion dollar company is to solve a problem people desperately want solved."

Desperation > mild interest.

> "It's remarkable how much being willing to work on a problem counts for."

Most people filter out hard problems. Don't.

> "Startups don't die, they just fade away. Usually because the founders start phoning it in."

Energy and commitment are everything.

## On Determination

> "As long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what matters most is determination."

Intelligence necessary but not sufficient.

> "Persistence is underrated and dramatically so."

Keep going when others quit.

> "The most important quality in a startup founder is determination. Intelligence is not."

Repeated because essential.

## On Ideas

> "The best ideas look initially like bad ideas."

Good ideas look obvious in retrospect, crazy in foresight.

> "If you want to come up with good ideas, notice anomalies and ask 'why?'"

Curiosity drives innovation.

> "The best startup ideas come from noticing something's missing."

Live in the future, build what's missing.

## On Work and Life

> "Family is more important than business. Put kids first, cram startup into remaining time."

Advice to a founder balancing family.

> "Work on stuff that matters to you. Life is too short to do otherwise."

Alignment between values and work.

> "The way to do really big things is to work on things you consider play."

Play at scale.

> "Don't just optimize for money. Optimize for interesting."

Money follows interesting work.

## On Investors and Fundraising

> "The biggest mistake founders make when pitching: talking too much instead of showing."

Demo > deck.

> "Investors are looking for excuses to say no."

Eliminate objections. Don't sell.

> "Deals fall through. Don't count on anything till the money's in the bank."

Hope is not a strategy.

## Contrarian Takes

> "It's remarkable how many people who've never run any kind of company think they know how to run a tech company better than someone who's run Tesla and SpaceX."

Armchair expertise vs. actual experience.

> "The conventional wisdom about how to run larger companies is mistaken."

Core thesis of Founder Mode.

> "Most 'obvious' things aren't."

Challenge assumptions.

> "People who are too agreeable rarely do great work."

Friction produces innovation.

## On Hiring and Teams

> "A small team of A players will run circles around a large team of B players."

Quality over quantity.

> "Don't hire until it hurts. Then hire slowly."

Resist premature scaling.

> "Hire people who give a shit."

Character matters.

## On Writing and Thinking

> "Write simply. Fancy writing obscures thinking."

Clarity over sophistication.

> "If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough."

Simplicity as proof of understanding.

## On Age and Timing

> "The best time to start a startup is now. The second best time is also now."

Stop waiting for perfect conditions.

> "Founders in their 20s have advantages, but so do those in their 40s."

Experience has value too.

## Memorable One-Liners

- "The default outcome of a startup is failure."
- "Startups are all-consuming. You either love it or you shouldn't do it."
- "Build something 100 people love, not something 1 million people kind of like."

- "The best founders are slightly disagreeable."
