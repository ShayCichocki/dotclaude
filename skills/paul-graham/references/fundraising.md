How to raise money—and how investors actually think.

## Core Principles

### Fundraise When You Don't Need To

- The best time to raise is when you don't desperately need money
- Desperation is obvious and kills negotiating power
- Being default alive transforms every investor conversation

### Get the First Yes

- The first commitment is the hardest
- Once you have one investor, others follow
- Social proof matters enormously in VC
- The herd mentality works for and against you

### Don't Optimize Terms, Optimize Closing

- A signed deal beats a better theoretical deal
- Negotiations that drag on can collapse
- Time kills deals
- Get the money and get back to building

## Investor Psychology

### What They're Really Thinking

"Investors are looking for excuses to say no."

They see hundreds of pitches. Their default is skepticism. Your job is to eliminate objections, not to convince.

### What Convinces Them

1. **Traction**: Actual users, actual revenue, actual growth
2. **Founder quality**: Do these people seem exceptional?
3. **Market size**: Is this potentially huge?
4. **Timing**: Why now?

### What Doesn't Work

- Elaborate business plans (they know plans are fiction)
- Projections (everyone projects hockey sticks)
- NDAs (makes you look naive)
- Overselling (they've heard it all)

### The Social Proof Game

"Investor herd dynamics" are real:
- Investors talk to each other
- Nobody wants to miss the deal everyone else wants
- Nobody wants to be first on a deal nobody else wants
- This creates momentum (good and bad)

## Practical Tactics

### The Meeting

- Be concise; investors have short attention spans
- Lead with traction or unique insight
- Know your numbers cold
- Show, don't tell (demo if possible)

### Following Up

- Investors will say "let me think about it" as default rejection
- Polite follow-up is fine; desperation is fatal
- Create urgency through real progress, not artificial deadlines

### Dealing with Rejection

- "No" often means "not yet"
- Don't argue with rejections
- Ask for intros to other investors
- Keep them updated on progress

## Fundraising Survival Guide

### Before You Raise

1. Have something real (product, users, traction)
2. Know your metrics by heart
3. Be able to articulate why now, why you
4. Set a realistic target and timeline

### During the Raise

1. Set a deadline (creates urgency)
2. Talk to many investors in parallel
3. Focus on the interested ones
4. Don't let fundraising consume all your time

### The Commitment Dance

- Get a lead investor first
- Use that commitment to attract others
- Don't celebrate until money is in the bank
- Deals fall through constantly

### After You Raise

- Get back to building immediately
- Spending will want to increase—resist
- The money should extend runway, not inflate burn
- Remember: more raises = more dilution

## Deals Fall Through

"Treat potential partnerships as background processes. Don't emotionally depend on uncertain deals."

This applies to:
- Fundraising rounds
- Acquisition offers
- Partnership discussions
- Key hire commitments

Mental model: assume it won't happen until it's done. This protects you from:
- Paralysis waiting for outcomes
- Making plans dependent on uncertainties
- The emotional crash when things fall apart
- Loss of negotiating leverage
