# Growth and Survival

How to know if you're on track—and what to do about it.

## Default Alive or Default Dead

The most important question for any startup with 8+ months of history.

### The Question

"Assuming your expenses remain constant and your revenue growth is what it has been over the last several months, do you make it to profitability on the money you have left?"

- **Default alive**: Yes → you're on track
- **Default dead**: No → you're burning toward zero

### Why This Matters

Most founders don't explicitly ask this question. They operate with vague optimism instead of clear trajectory analysis. Knowing your status changes everything about how you should operate.

### The Fatal Pinch

The worst situation: **default dead** + **slow growth** + **not enough time to fix it**.

When you're in a fatal pinch:
- Investors can tell (they won't say it)
- Your negotiating leverage is zero
- The clock is ticking toward death

### The #1 Killer

"Hiring too fast is the biggest killer of startups that raise money."

After raising:
- Founders feel flush and hire aggressively
- Burn rate jumps
- Runway shrinks
- Growth doesn't increase proportionally
- Suddenly you're default dead

### What to Do If Default Dead

1. Cut expenses immediately (usually means layoffs)
2. Focus ruthlessly on what drives growth
3. Fundraise from a position of strength, not desperation
4. Consider: can you become ramen profitable quickly?

## Ramen Profitable

The survival milestone that changes everything.

### Definition

"Ramen profitable" = generating enough revenue to cover founders' minimal living expenses (ramen noodles budget).

### Why It Matters

- **Removes fundraising pressure**: You don't need money to survive
- **Changes investor dynamics**: You're choosing them, not begging
- **Improves morale**: Team knows you're sustainable
- **Enables patience**: You can wait for the right opportunity

### The Psychology

"A startup's destination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trick for not dying en route."

You're not comfortable, but you're alive. That's enough to find your way to the big opportunity.

## Startup = Growth

Growth rate is the defining characteristic.

### The Math

- **Good**: 5-7% weekly growth
- **Great**: 10% weekly growth
- **Not a startup**: Flat or declining

### Compounding Magic

| Weekly Growth | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| 1% | 1.7x | 2.8x |
| 5% | 12x | 150x |
| 10% | 142x | 20,000x |

### Growth as Compass

When you're growing:
- You know something is working
- You have clarity on what to optimize
- Investors are interested
- Recruiting gets easier

When you're not:
- Something fundamental is broken
- Don't paper over it with more features
- Find the real problem

### Measuring Growth

- Pick one metric that matters most (usually revenue or active users)
- Measure it weekly
- Make it visible to everyone
- Let it drive every decision

## The Cockroach Mode

When things are dire:

1. **Cut to survive**: Whatever it takes to become default alive
2. **Focus on unit economics**: Can you make money on each transaction?
3. **Get to cash-flow positive**: Even if it means staying small temporarily
4. **Live to fight another day**: Many great companies nearly died early on

## Warning Signs

- Celebrating funding rounds instead of customer wins
- Hiring ahead of revenue
- Burn rate growing faster than revenue
- Founders losing touch with metrics
- "We'll figure it out" without concrete plans
