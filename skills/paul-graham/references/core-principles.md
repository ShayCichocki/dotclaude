# Core Startup Principles

Paul Graham's essential frameworks for building startups.

## The 13 Sentences

PG's most condensed startup wisdom:

1. **Pick good cofounders** — Cofounders are like location in real estate. You can change everything except them.

2. **Launch fast** — Launching reveals what you should actually build. Real work begins after launch.

3. **Let your idea evolve** — Most valuable ideas emerge during implementation, not planning.

4. **Understand your users** — Wealth = users × how much you improve their lives. Deep understanding reveals unmet needs.

5. **Make a few users love you** — Better to satisfy all needs of a small group than partial needs of many. This scales.

6. **Offer surprisingly good customer service** — Exceed lowered expectations. Early personalized support teaches invaluable lessons.

7. **You make what you measure** — "Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it."

8. **Spend little** — Cost discipline enables rapid iteration. Most startups die from running out of money.

9. **Get ramen profitable** — Reach self-sufficiency. Transforms investor relationships and team morale.

10. **Avoid distractions** — Side income and fundraising pull focus despite short-term appeal.

11. **Don't get demoralized** — The real killer is lost focus, not lack of funds. Manage psychological weight intentionally.

12. **Don't give up** — Persistent effort usually succeeds. Keep adapting forward.

13. **Deals fall through** — Treat potential partnerships as background processes. Don't emotionally depend on uncertain outcomes.

## Do Things That Don't Scale

The most counterintuitive and essential startup principle.

### Core Insight

"A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don't. You almost always have to make them take off."

### Manual User Recruitment

- You can't wait for users to come to you
- Go get them manually—door to door if needed
- **Collison installation**: When someone agrees to try your product, say "Right then, give me your laptop" and set them up on the spot

### Obsessive Customer Delight

- Treat early users extraordinarily well
- Wufoo sent handwritten thank-you notes to every new user
- Tim Cook can't send you a handwritten note, but you can
- "This is one of the advantages of being small: you can deliver a level of service no big company can"

### Narrow Market Focus

- Start with a deliberately constrained audience
- Facebook launched only for Harvard students—created immediate relevance
- Pinterest focused on design blogger conferences
- Depth beats breadth in the beginning

### Manual Before Automation

- Perform tasks manually before building systems
- Stripe manually enrolled merchants behind the scenes initially
- Manual work teaches you what to eventually automate
- Fake it till you make it (but only temporarily)

### The Exponential Math

- Focus on consistent weekly growth rates
- 10% weekly growth = 14,000 users after 1 year, 2 million after 2 years
- The compounding is magical if you can maintain momentum

## The One Mistake That Kills Startups

"In a sense there's just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want. If you make something users want, you'll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do."

## The Three Essentials

You need three things:
1. Good people
2. Something customers actually want
3. Spend as little money as possible

Most startups that fail do so because they fail at one of these.
